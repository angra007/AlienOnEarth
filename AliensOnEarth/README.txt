About Software:
This is a application to register details of Aliens and export the details into a selected file format. This
application is highly dynamic and can easily be extended. Users can either have registered themselves
earlier or they can start a new registration process. AlienRegistration.h/.m manages all the registration
related task and validate input. If the user has already registered AlienDetailsReader.h/.m class reads
the saved details. In both cases, a registered user is allowed to export their data. ExportManager.h/.m
class manages all the export related tasks. This class looks into all the available export types and
initialize the export according to the user input. Exporter.h/.m is the super class for all the export type.
This class provides the data to export whereas all the export type will provide the logic to create file.

To extend this code just subclass from Exporter and implement -createFileWithData:. No other code changes
are required. This application will check for all the available export type available at runtime and proceed
accordingly. In the new file call -provideDataForObject to fetch the data. Give the drawing logic . To
create a new file call -writeFileAtPath: withCompletionHandler:. Define a completion handler depending on
how to want to handle completion
